    "### DATA DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this task is taken from Machine Learning Datasets in BigQuery Google Public Dataset. The data is retrieved by querying the `census_adult_income` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The columns taken from `census_adult_income` are `age, workclass, education, education_num, marital_status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country, and income_bracket`. The data taken from these columns also has a condition where the `workclass` does not contain the `?` character and the hours per week are less than 100 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the dataset link: [Dataset Link](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=ml_datasets&t=census_adult_income&page=table)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the data dictionary :\n",
    "\n",
    "- age : the age of a person\n",
    "- workclass: type of work agency\n",
    "- education: the last education grade\n",
    "- education number: estimated years of education completed based on the value of the education field.\n",
    "- marital_status : the state of being married or not married\n",
    "- occupation: current job\n",
    "- relationship: status in the family\n",
    "- sex : gender of a person\n",
    "- capital_gain : profit earned on the sale of an asset which has increased in value over the holding period\n",
    "- capital_loss : the loss incurred when a capital asset, such as an investment or real estate, decreases in value.\n",
    "- hour_per_week : number of hours worked per week\n",
    "- native_country : one's country of origin\n",
    "- income_bracket : one's category of income falls within defined upper and lower levels\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBJECTIVES\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the task is to be able to create a classification model using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine to predict `income_bracket` using existing datasets."
